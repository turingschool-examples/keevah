## The Pivot - Keevahh

Keevahh is a micro-lending platform that allows both lenders and borrowers to interact. Borrowers are able to create a project or loan request and lenders are able to contribute to various projects.

The project specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.markdown)

[Find Us Here on Heroku](https://lendkeevahh.herokuapp.com/)

## Working With Data Dumps

### Loading the pre-seeded DB dump

This project includes a rake task to load a pre-seeded
DB dump with all the data you will need. It is currently
stored on Turing's dropbox. To download and import it,
use this rake task:

```
$ rake db:pg_restore
```

### Pushing Data to Heroku

Once you've populated your local DB, you can also push those
records to a heroku instance.

1. Create heroku instance (heroku create)
2. Use `heroku pg:push` to export your local data into
the instance. For example:

```
$ heroku pg:push the_pivot_development DATABASE_URL
```
